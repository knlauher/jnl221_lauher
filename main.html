	<p> AUSTIN — Mallory Swanson, a dynamic attacker for the U.S. women’s national soccer team, appeared to suffer a serious knee injury Saturday during a 2-0 victory over Ireland, a potentially massive setback for the top-ranked Americans three months before the World Cup. </p>

	<p> She was taken to a hospital, but the U.S. Soccer Federation did not immediately offer any updates. “Hopefully we get good news,” Coach Vlatko Andonovski said. </p>

	<p> Swanson, who scored seven goals in the first five U.S. matches this year, was hurt in the 40th minute on a challenge by Ireland’s Aoife Mannion near midfield. The 24-year-old winger howled in pain as teammate Rose Lavelle comforted her. Other teammates came to her aid, and as U.S. staff raced onto the field, several players waved for the medical cart. </p>

	<p> “It didn’t look great,” Lavelle said. “She wasn’t in a great place. She was in a lot of pain. We’re all trying to help calm her down. Glad we could be close to her and help her in that moment, but obviously a scary situation.” </p>

	<p> Swanson’s left leg was immobilized, and she was placed on a stretcher before being loaded onto the cart. She waved to the crowd and used her hands to make a heart symbol before being taken to a hospital. </p>

	<p> Andonovski and the players said she was in much better spirits than when the incident occurred. “When she was going off the field, she had a big smile on her face and said: ‘Coach, I’m good. I promise, I’ll be good,’” Andonovski said. “Okay, you’re stronger than me,” Andonovski said he told her.</p>

	<p> Swanson’s leg injury occurred 16 minutes after the winger was hurt pursuing a pass in the penalty area. Nudged off-balance by Mannion, Swanson collided with goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan and appeared to injure her head. Following treatment on the field and sideline, she returned to the match. </p>

	<p> “Mal is a very lovable person,” Andonovski said. “She’s this happy person [who] brings joy in the environment. The staff, the players, everybody was affected by it, but right now we’re all just hoping for good news and hoping we’re going to see her back on the field soon.”</p>

	<p> Swanson entered the day having scored in six consecutive matches. On a front line also featuring Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith, she is a key figure as the United States will seek to become the first men’s or women’s team to win three straight world titles. </p>

	<p> Saturday’s match, in front of an announced sellout of 20,593 at Q2 Stadium, was the team’s third-to-last test before the World Cup, set for July 20 to Aug. 20 in Australia and New Zealand. The Americans will play Ireland again Tuesday in St. Louis as well as a July 9 send-off game at a West Coast venue vs. an opponent to be announced. </p>

	<p> “It was hard to see her go down like that,” said midfielder Lindsey Horan, adding she was still “choked up” about the injury. </p>

	<p> Swanson (nee Pugh) was enjoying a career renaissance. After turning pro at 19, she fell short of expectations early in her NWSL career and didn’t make a major impact on the national team. She was left off the Olympic squad for the Tokyo Games in 2021. Last year, though, she starred with the NWSL’s Chicago Red Stars (14 goals in 18 appearances) and the national team (seven goals and seven assists in 15 matches).</p>

	<p> Trinity Rodman, who replaced Swanson; veteran Megan Rapinoe, who is not with the team because of a calf injury; and Lynn Williams would be the top candidates to start should Swanson miss the World Cup. </p>

	<p> Swanson’s injury occurred shortly after Emily Fox, a right back from Ashburn, Va., broke a scoreless match with her first goal in 28 international appearances. It was a terrific attempt from beyond the penalty area, coming after she moved to push the ball to her right and shot back to the lower far corner. </p>

	<p> “I had an opportunity before that, and I didn’t take it, so next time I get a chance, I’m going to do it,” Fox said. </p>

	<p> Despite remaining perfect in 14 meetings with No. 22 Ireland, the United States labored to ward off the visitors in the first half and was fortunate not to fall behind. </p>

	<p> “The first half was spooky at times,” Lavelle said. </p>

	<p> “It was very obvious things did not work well for us in the beginning,” Andonovski said. “Very proud of the group in how they handled those moments. They were persistent. They stayed true to what we believe in. And they figured it out. They found a way to break the opponent.” </p>

	<p> The Americans created a wealth of opportunities in the second half but did not double the lead until the 80th minute on Horan’s penalty kick.</p>

	<p> The second half also featured <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/04/04/julie-ertz-uswnt-ireland/" target="_blank"> the return of midfielder Julie Ertz, </a> who made her first appearance since the Tokyo <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_1" target="_blank"> Olympics. </a> With her husband, NFL star Zach Ertz, and their 7-month-old son, Madden, in attendance, the two-time World Cup champion entered in the 67th minute. </p> 

	<p> “It was a joy to be back,” she said. “I might have been smiling the whole time playing.” </p>

	<p> Ertz, a free agent who is expected to sign with an NWSL team soon, is vying for one of the last World Cup roster slots. Andonovski will name the 23-woman roster in June. </p>

	<p> Ertz’s exuberance Saturday overtook her at times. </p>

	<p> “She was getting a little bit off-script,” Andonovski said, “but it is understandable.” </p>

	<p> Just minutes after entering, Ertz returned to her crunching style and received a yellow card. </p>

	<p> “My eyes were the size of my whole face,” she said, “so I think my excitement got the best of me.” </p>

	<p> All of that, though, was overshadowed by Swanson’s injury. </p>

	<p> “It’s really hard to see Mal go down in pain like that before the World Cup,” Morgan said. “We just have to hope she will be good.” </p>
