        <h1>A little bit about me!</h1>
        
        <h2>My intro</h2>
        <p> My name is <strong> Kendyl Lauher </strong> I'm from North Carolina, born and raised, however, I moved from Charlotte to Davidson when I was in fifth grade. Most of my extended family still lives in either Maryland or Virginia where my parents grew up. My older sister, Jordan (24), was born in Delaware, but I've never even been since my family moved from there to NC about 6 months before I was born. 
        <p> Fun fact: My grandparents got married just a couple months after interracial marriage became legal. Without the <i> Loving v. Virginia </i> court case my family would essentially not exist! 
        <p> Nowadays, my entire life basically revolves around soccer as I'm a member of the Syracuse Women's Soccer Team! </p>
